# python-challenge

For this assignment, I've analyzed two CSV data sets in Python. 

PyBank is an example of financial analysis where I calculate net total profits/losses over the entire period, the changes in profit/losses over the entire period and the average of those changes, and determine the amount and corresponding month for the greatest increase and decrease in profits.

PyPoll is an example of election analysis where I tally votes for each candidate, determine the total number and percentage of votes each candidate won, and determine the winner based on popular vote.
